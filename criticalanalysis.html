  <h2><center> Critical Analysis </center></h2>
  <h4>Reflection on Final</h4>
    <p>The first part of this reflection will focus on the decision making of this final project. The first time doing the skills assignment was very rudimentary, and in the end, incomplete. The links were dead, there was no homepage, and the appearance was passable. At the time, the fact that I created an HTML page with a CSS stylesheet was miraculous enough. </p>
    <p>Previously, while I learned how to code with HTML and CSS, I did not know what to do with the information, or how the knowledge I have can become something that looks more professional. Over the course of 3 more projects, I was able to work more on webpage development and get myself exposed to resources. Now I have color palettes to choose from, website templates to refer to, seen other classmates’ websites, and simply practiced more by creating webpages for each synthesis projects. While I knew a few classmates to talk to in the beginning of class, we were all completely clueless on how to approach each problem. However, since the Team Assignment, I’ve had a variety of classmates, especially Maya, to ask for help on topics that they’ve learned outside of class or from other classes. </p>
    <p>The template and color palette for this website was loosely based off a <a href="http://www.neopets.com/~xaia">Xaia</a>, a directory of CSS templates for Neopets webpages. I wanted to replicate the basic format without inspecting the code. <center><img src="whitespace.png" alt="Xaia" style="width:800px;height:400px;"></center></p>
    <p>Many stylizations such as the hover effect on links, and trouble shooting was made possible by scanning the w3 school’s webpage.
    </p>
    <p>Simply the fact that it took a week to complete the first Skills Assignment versus the two days it took to create this website speaks to the level of comfort I have with creating webpages.</p>
  <h4>Reflection on the Class</h4>
    <p>The second part of this reflection will focus on the learning process of the class. When I first began, I underestimated how much of coding is practice based, and overestimated how much I would learn. For the synthesis projects, I thought the workflow would go:
      <ol>
        <li></li>Learn the code necessary to create the data visualization
        <li></li>Find an interesting dataset and clean it up.
        <li></li>Create a template that would show exactly what you wanted to show with your data
        <li></li>Apply the dataset onto the template
        <li></li>Reap an A+
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>In actuality, there is no end to the amount of code I can learn before attempting the visualization. From experience, now I know the best thing to do is to simply begin drafting it and then learn the coding needed for the visualization. </p>
    <p>Datasets are also proven difficult to perform calculations or clean up on a python that’s not incorporated into a tutorial. The first time I used a set, I ended up using Microsoft Excel to perform the calculations because the tools I used from DataCamp could not be applied to my dataset. The second time, I made sure to find and create a dataset that I know how to use the functions on. For the Group Synthesis, I learned how to use Oxygen in addition to Python and Excel to clean up data. </p>
    <p>I also overestimated how difficult to create a template from scratch when I’ve had zero experience coding with python. For the first project, I wanted to create piecharts with its own unique colors, shading, and fonts. I quickly realize that to write a code for that from scratch, I would be looking up templates already existing online for reference anyways. </p>
    <p>Furthermore, the dataset often does not copy paste perfectly into the python code. For the second Synthesis, ClapCut, my initial draft was to graph each cut of a movie on a stacked bar graph with each segmented bar representing the cut’s time and duration. However, all templates for stacked bar graphs plot one stack at a time, thus I would have to type in over a thousand variables with one entry to graph my bar chart. That was another draft that ended up in the trash.</p>
    <p>The process is simply hard. So what can I do about this? Continue practicing. What was invaluable from the learning process in this class compared to other computer science classes is how it points me to all the resources the internet has to offer: Coursera, Codeacademy, DataCamp, and the million banks of resources is literally all untapped. I don’t have to rely on a professor’s lectures to get the information. </p>
    <p>So even though I am graduating this year, I can continue improving my current assignments and adding more skills to my head to use on future projects</p>
  <h4>Future Goals and Workplan</h4>
    <p>Because I am interested in library science and naturally drawn to archival efforts, I found a website called <a href="http://www.cameronsworld.net/">Cameron’s World</a> that brings together thousands of GeoCities pages that were shut down when GeoCities shut down in 2009 to preserve their aesthetics and significance. I hope to be able to study what aesthetic principles its pages abides by, and be able to replicate it on a webpage of my own.<center><img src="cameron's world.png" alt="Xaia" style="width:800px;height:400px;"></center></p>
    <p>Just from the knowledge I have right now, this would mean having to…
      <ul>
        <li>Learn how GeoCities worked, what media it’s able to host, and its limitations.</li> Learn how GeoCities worked, what media it’s able to host, and its limitations.
        <li>Contact Cameron Askin, the creator of the website, on how he obtained archival access to these dead pages.</li>
        <li>Establish GeoCities aesthetics: </li>
          <ul>
            <li>What types of songs are usually being played?</li>
            <li>How are the different media elements arranged on the page?</li>
            <li>What are the 1990s internet aesthetics?</li>
            <li>How much of it is possible to replicate, and how much of those aesthetics do I want to keep in the replication?</li>
          </ul>
        <li>Learn more Javascript to create the responsive popups and pages </li>
        <li>How to stack and layer windows, divs, and gifs onto each other.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>From experience, I know there would be a lot more difficulties to arise. Connor has taken a liking to this page as well and suggested on creating a filter that would change modern day websites into GeoCities pages. While it is already difficult to create a page with a GeoCities appearance from scratch, it would be even harder to create one with some sort of algorithm that summarizes GeoCities. I actually have no idea how to even begin this one, but I have examples to study for reference at the moment:</p>
    <p>
        <ul>
          <li>nCage: a Chrome extension that replaces all images on all pages with pictures of Nicolas Cage instead. I think it uses Google Images as a database to draw Nicolas Cage pictures from.</li>
          <li>Comic Sansation: replaces all fonts used with Comic Sans. This would be useful to change a website’s font.</li>
          <li>Random Memes: automatically plays a meme song at random.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>I hope to create smaller projects that can explore different formats for this filter, such as making it a chrome extension, a facebook app, or a website of its own, and so on. </p>
