  <tr><th class="bg-primary text-white">Start time/date</th><th class="bg-primary text-white">End time/date</th><th class="bg-primary text-white">Description of focus</th><th class="bg-primary text-white">Notes on process</th>
  <tr><td>1/8 12am</td><td>12:10am</td><td>To scope out the assignment</td><td>opened the syllabus and checkout both Lyanda and Codeacademy and chose to watch Lyanda videos but fell asleep before any real learning happened. I want to note that I decided to omit some entries where I could tell I logged in my start time and the rest of the table is blank and you can tell I just opened Codeacademy page on a tab and just forgot about it.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>1/10 3am</td><td>4am</td><td>Finish 30 minutes of Lyanda videos</td><td>Watched 15 minutes of Github on Lyanda and had to rewind and take notes.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>1/13 12am</td><td>2am</td><td>Finish the Lyanda videos for Github</td><td>Done! Amazing! Took notes and all!</td></tr>
  <tr><td>1/14 4pm</td><td>12am</td><td>Complete the entirely of Github Codeacademy</td><td>Trapped myself in Market so I can't get out without wasting $6. Took a break every time Codeacademy displayed a "Congrats on Finishing ____" and felt I had to celebrate by grabbing some pasta or tea. Began a doc of all the skills and commands I learned to keep track, especially since the information past Part IV began to muddle and be unexplained. Took one large break by eating dinner, then finished up the Codeacademy by 10pm. Played around Github for a long time by experimenting with master branches, downloading Github Desktop, and Git Bash. Made a lot of extra repositories and an extra account to make experimental pull requests and pushes until Market staff kicked me out.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>1/17 9pm</td><td>10pm</td><td>Google competencies</td><td>Realized Codeacademy and Lyanda didn't quite cover everything, so I googled the rest of the stuff on the competencies list.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>1/21 12am</td><td>2am</td><td>Start learning HTML</td><td>Got through the HTML section of Codeacademy.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>1/24 11am</td></td><td></td><td>begin Javascript on Codeacademy</td><td>Made it through a few lessons of Javascript and began looking at the assignment. Experimented on Tumblr websites and changed various html elements.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>1/27 12am</td><td>6am</td><td>Finish Javascript></td><td>Completed Javascript part II on Codeacademy, clicked the lessons page, and realized I never completed the HTML and CSS lessons, so went back and completed everthing. Took notes and everything. Went back to Tumblr to experiment but still can't see the difference between inline, inline-block, and block displays... like what the hell? Sweated nervously throughout the entire process.</td></tr>

<h4>Synthesis 1</h4>
<p>Because I did not keep track of learning log after the Skills Assignment, I'm just going to discuss the learning process for Python and data visualization in the Analysis section.</p>
