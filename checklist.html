    <table>
        <tr><th><center>Item</center></th><th><center>Comments</center></th></tr>
          <tr><td>Basics of command line git</td><td>Done as of 1//12 after days of procrastination.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Checkout, branch, merge, etc.</td><td>Done as of 1/14. This was actually the easier to understand than the Command line.</td></tr>
              <tr><td>Github issues, web interface</td><td>Done. Looked over notes from class and  the powerpoint to refresh myself</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Github pages: how to host a static HTML on Github</td><td>This actually took me forever. We went over this in class and I went "yea I've got it". Went home, and realized I'd forgotten everything and Google did not help.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Basic markdown, README.md</td><td>Surprisingly, I knew about these things before coding from downloading software and exploring them.</td></tr>
      </table>
  <p>.</p>
  <p style= "font-weight: bold">HTML and CSS</p>
  <table>
    <tr><th><center>Item</center></th><th><center>Comments</center></th></tr>
    <tr><td>Document Object Model (DOM)</td><td>Went over in class.</td></tr>

    <tr><td>External, Internal, and Inline CSS</td><td>After learning external CSS, all other CSS forms seemed useless to me.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Selecting by class and id</td><td>This is so useful!</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Common CSS font properties</td><td>I don't understand why Comic Sans is considered cursive. It got me thinking if fonts like Wingdings are cursive or sans-serif or not. I decided not to google it because I don't want myself to find information that will make websites ugly.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Common layout properties</td><td>divs and position:fixed are my friends.</td></tr>
  </table>

  <p style= "font-weight: bold">Javascript, JSON, and jQuery</p>

    <tr><th><center>Item</center></th><th><center>Comments</center></th></tr>
    <tr><td>Basic Bootstrap 3 shortcuts</td><td>Only learned the ones on a Mac, but not on windows.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>What is javascript, and when is it usually used?</td><td>It is NOT Java. Javascript gives webpages some interactability between the HTML interace and me, the user.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Difference between Javascript and jQuery</td><td>jQuery is  a Javascript library to manage HTML. So I have to lear more about Javascript before JQuery. However, I couldn't get this far.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>What is JSON?</td><td>All I know is this will become very important later when we work with data.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>How to link to Bootstrap 3 javascript dependency</td><td>Ok, I confess I still do not know and am very confused. Did not get this far</td></tr>
